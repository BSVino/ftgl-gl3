Note: This is a special version FTGL. It was ported to OpenGLES by David Petrie and
bugfixed and put together with the original autoconf build system by James Long.

Then it was (poorly) ported to OpenGL 3.0 by Jorge Rodriguez. So far only Windows is
supported and it still has some build issues, but Linux/Mac porting should not be difficult.

===========

FTGL 2.1 For OpenGL 3.0
5 December 2004

DESCRIPTION:

FTGL is a free open source library to enable developers to use arbitrary
fonts in their OpenGL (www.opengl.org) applications.

Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats
so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data
into a lesser quality, proprietary format.

FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode'
the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient
for OpenGL rendering.

Rendering modes supported are:
- Bit maps
- Antialiased Pix maps
- Outlines
- Polygon meshes
- Extruded polygon meshes
- Texture maps
- Buffer maps

USAGE:

	FTGLPixmapFont font("Arial.ttf");
	font.FaceSize(72);
	font.Render("Hello World!");
