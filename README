Note: This is a special version FTGL. It was ported to OpenGLES by David Petrie and
bugfixed and put together with the original autoconf build system by James Long.

Then it was (poorly) ported to OpenGL 3.0 by Jorge Rodriguez. So far Windows and
Linux are supported, but Mac porting should not be difficult. If you have problems
contact Jorge Rodriguez <jorge@lunarworkshop.com>

FTGL 2.1 For OpenGL 3.0
5 December 2004

DESCRIPTION:

FTGL is a free open source library to enable developers to use arbitrary
fonts in their OpenGL (www.opengl.org) applications.

Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats
so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font data
into a lesser quality, proprietary format.

FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode'
the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient
for OpenGL rendering.

FTGL used to support many different rendering modes, but these days most of those
are obsolete. The only mode which survives in FTGL for GL3 is texture map mode.

USAGE:

	FTTextureFont font("Arial.ttf");
	font.FaceSize(72);
	font.Render("Hello World!");
